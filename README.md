# Quiz_Application
This project is a comprehensive quiz application developed in Java, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface built with Swing and AWT, and integrated with a MySQL database for persistent data storage. 

 Key Features:
1. User Registration and Login- Users can register by providing a User ID, password, and phone number, which are stored in the database. They can then log in to access the quiz.

2. Quiz Gameplay- The quiz presents a series of multiple-choice questions with a 30-second timer per question. Users can select answers, use a 50-50 lifeline, and navigate through questions.

3. Database Connectivity- The application connects to a MySQL database to store user credentials, quiz scores, and other relevant data using JDBC.

4. User Interface - The application features a well-designed interface with components for displaying questions, options, and game rules, as well as showing the userâ€™s final score.

5. Score Management - After completing the quiz, user scores are recorded in the database, and users are provided with an option to play again.

This project showcases a robust understanding of Java programming, GUI design, and database interaction.
